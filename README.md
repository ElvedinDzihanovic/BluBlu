Unity game created for Hackathon „Zajedno postižemo više“, Mostar 2017. The game won first place in the first round of competition.

The game controller is based on object-detection. The user chooses an object which will be used as a controller (his/her hand, a ball,
a coffee cup or something similar) and uses it to control a box in order to catch as many objects as possible.
Object detection was handled using a python script which runs OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library). Everything else was coded using Unity.
